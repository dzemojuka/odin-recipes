# odin-recipes
This is a practice project I made for The Odin Project's Web Developer learning program.
It is a website with a homepage that has links to 3 recipes pages. 
Everything is made in HTML. The goal of the project was to showcase my understanding of the HTML programming language.
I used text, images, links and list elements in this website. 
Looking forward to learning more and improving!
