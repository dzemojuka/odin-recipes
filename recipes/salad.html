    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        People tend to forget to eat salads and other raw foods in the cold weather. This salad is a good way to get your greens by combining 
        somewhat heartier salad textures. I find that this salad is filling enough to be a main course, with a bit of bread or some rice cakes 
        on the side. It will also work as an appetizer in a smaller serving.
